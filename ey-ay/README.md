ai ml ds nlp falan idk i'm not a scientist

most files have been moved to kaggle, you can take a look at them at this link <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hakancangunerli/code"> here.</a>

the rest of the files are here. i know it's weird, codes here are executed in google colab, whereas ones at kaggle aren't. they'll most likely be moved as well.

## Installation

Don't clone.

## why

well, i keep most of my unfinished repos in my BitBucket. however, github has good implementation for certain products like heroku etc and so I need a repo to experiment on. it's like a homelab, except it's not melting my computer, it''ll be melting your computer.

## Acknowledgements

Note: this is not 100% my code, I took a lot of advice from all over the place. I test at bitbucket, and if it works out it'll be its own repository on GitHub.
