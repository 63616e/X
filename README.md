everything starts here. 


# experimentation-station
area for experimentation, and sub repo creation
## why?
well, i keep most of my unfinished repos in [my BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/hakancangunerli/ "link to my bb"). however, github has good implementation for certain products like heroku etc and so I need a repo to experiment on. it's like a homelab, except it's not melting my computer, it''ll be melting _your computer_. 

### clone

why would you clone this? it's an experimentation station.
