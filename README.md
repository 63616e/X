# X, the experiment station

everything starts here.area for experimentation, and sub repo creation

## Installation

Don't clone.

## why

well, i keep most of my unfinished repos in my BitBucket. however, github has good implementation for certain products like heroku etc and so I need a repo to experiment on. it's like a homelab, except it's not melting my computer, it''ll be melting your computer.

## Acknowledgements

Note: this is not 100% my code, I took a lot of advice from all over the place. I test at bitbucket, and if it works out it'll be its own repository on GitHub.
