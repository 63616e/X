# X, the experiment station

everything starts here.area for experimentation, and sub repo creation

## Installation

Don't clone.

## why

well, i moved most of my projects to github, but i don't want to keep creating repos. instead, i push them here first and then make them their own repo afterwards.

## Acknowledgements

Note: this is not 100% my code, I took a lot of advice from all over the place. I test at bitbucket, and if it works out it'll be its own repository on GitHub.
